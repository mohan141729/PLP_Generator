#  Personalized Learning Path Generator

PLP generator is a full-stack web application that helps users create personalized learning paths for any topic using AI. The application consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Project Overview

PLP Generator uses the Google Gemini API to generate comprehensive, multi-level learning paths tailored to users' needs. Each learning path includes:
- Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels
- Curated modules with learning resources
- Practical projects
- Progress tracking
- User metrics and analytics

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS
- `backend/` - Node.js Express server with SQLite database

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your Google Gemini API key as an environment variable named `API_KEY`

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with necessary configuration

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run on port 5000 by default.
